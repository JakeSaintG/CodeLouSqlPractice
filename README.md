# Code:YOU SQLite Demo and Exercises
Welcome! In this repo, we will go over everything you need to know to get a solid foundation of using databases with SQL. We will be focusing on writing and running queries against CatDB. 


- not covering code
    - The topics covered here can help you write better, more informed code against SQLite databases


## SQL Terminology

While it is best to use these exercises to solidify your SQL understanding, 

check Terminology.md




## Recommended Tools
These exercises will not require an extensive knowledge base for using available tools. For our purposes, we just want to view and query the SQLite database. 

### SQLite Extension
The recommended tool to complete these exercises would be a popular [SQLite extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexcvzz.vscode-sqlite) for VSCode:
- ![extension search result](./other/README_Imgs/extension.png)
- This extension will allow us to open a connection to CatDB and easily run SQL queries.

### DB Browser for SQLITE
An alternative tool would be [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org).
- WARNING: This tool can get a bit confusing for new users since it utilizes a db-journal file and has a save feature. You are not technically running queries directly against the database.
- It is available to download for Mac, Windows, and Linux.
