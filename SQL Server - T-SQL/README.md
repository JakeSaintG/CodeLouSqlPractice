# CatDB
## Note:
This is the *original* version of the SQL Practice using scripts made for SQL Server (SQL Server Management Studio). For SQLite practice, head back to the root of the repo. If you have SQL Server on your machine and want to give these a shot, feel free!

## An intro to SQL and Practice
- CatDB can be used to learn and practice basic SQL concepts.
- This exercise is meant to be used in conjuction with the Code Louisville Software Development Level 2 Course.
- You will find breakdowns and explainations in the comments of each SQL file in this repo.

## Create Scripts
- In the Schema folder, you will find two folders for each schema.
    - Run each script in the order listed by the file name.
    - These will create the schema, tables, and base data for the exercises.
- The Utils folder houses a script to drop and recreate all BASE tables in one shot.
    - The data from the Create Scripts will need to be run to populate the data.

## Exercises
- To run through the exercises in an order that builds on itself, go through the files in the order listed in the file names.
