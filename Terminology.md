## SQL
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is the "code" behind reading information out of data storage (databases).
    - It is often pronounced "sequel" or "S-Q-L".

- SQL is a HIGHLY overloaded acronymâ€¦
    - Job desciptions will just say "SQL" sometimes without elaboarting. Will applicants just need to know `SELECT *` and `DROP TABLE` or will they be maintaining/architecting databases? 

## AnsiSQL
- "SQL" has a standard behind it called AnsiSQL that sets up the bones for many different SQL technologies. These include tSQL on applications SQL Server or other implementations like MySQL and SQLite. 
- There are other database technologies that do not implement SQL or AnsiSQL like MongoDB, Cassandra, and Elasticsearch but those will not be covered here.

## Database
- So far, we have said that SQL is the language for reading and writing information. Reading and writing to where? Databases.
- Databases are the main "shell" for storing information in organized and retrievable ways.
